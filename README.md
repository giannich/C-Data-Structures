# C-Data-Structures

This repository has a bunch of data structures I used for my Advanced Programming Class in C.
This was the first time I took a C-programming class, so the code might look horrible.
I might have also forgotten to properly manage my memory, but at least the code is heavily commented.
Will update and clean the files whenever I get some free time :D
